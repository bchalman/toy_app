This is a demo microblogging application with limited functionality built as an introduction to scaffold generators and to delve deeper into Rails structure.

Part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet?ref=lnav)'s curriculum, this follows [The Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app) by Michael Hartl.
